        <h2>Launching Rockets With LUNAR</h2>
        <p>LUNAR flies from two sites: <a href="#snow-ranch">Snow Ranch</a>, 30 minutes east of Stockton on
            California Highway 4, and <a href="#brigantino">Brigantino Park</a> in Hollister, California.</p>
        <p><span title="The American Rocketry Challenge">(T)ARC</span> teams are welcome to fly at our launches, but
            must be aware they are sharing the site with other fliers and cannot expect priority.</p>
        <p>Launches are open to all LUNAR members, and non-members pay a $20 fee per group.</p>

        <h2>Snow Ranch</h2>
        <p><strong>Next Launch</strong>: Saturday, January 3rd, 2026</p>

        <figcaption>A view of the Snow Ranch launch site</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The Snow Ranch launch site is located on California Highway 4 about 30 miles east of Stockton, California.</p>
        <p>The Ranch is about an hour drive from Livermore. The field is certified Level 3 with a 15,000 foot
            ceiling. We are currently allowing up to M motors on that field. You will need to get LUNAR board
            approval before flying L or M class engines (> 2,560 N).</p>
        <p>The launch site is on <a href="http://www.orvisranch.com/">an operating cattle ranch</a> so normal ranch rules apply.
        <ul>
            <li>If you open a gate, close it.</li>
            <li>Don't bother the bulls, cows, and especially the calves.</li>
            <li>Don't tear up the turf.</li>
            <li>Stay on the marked roads. In the wet months your car will get stuck in the mud if you stray off the
                road.</li>
            <li>There are wild animals in the area, including squirrels, rabbits, rattle snakes, coyotes, eagles,
                and mountain lions. Keep an eye on your children and don't stick your hands and feet where you
                cannot see. Especially stay away from the rock fences, the black berry bushes, and the brushy rock
                formations. They are full of snakes but they won't bother you if you don't bother them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are no amenities at the field so bring everything that you will need. We will rent a porta potty
            for the event.</p>
        <p>Note, however, that you can only count on flying motors up through G-class on a drop-in basis (conditions
            permitting.) Flying H and larger motors requires both HPR Level 1 certification (NAR or TRA) and the
            presence of a licensed Class III Pyrotechnician to supervise the flight. There are a few licensees in
            the club, so it is likely (but not guaranteed) that one will be on hand at any given launch.</p>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <address>
            Orvis Cattle Company<br>
            9601 East CA-4<br>
            Farmington, CA<br>
            95230
        </address>
        <p>If you are traveling north or south on Interstate 5, travel to Stockton and take the cross town freeway east to highway 99. Go south on 99 one exit to the State Highway 4 exit. Go east on Highway 4 over the freeway and continue about 17 miles to Farmington. Continue east on Highway 4. About 10 miles beyond Farmington you will cross the Milton-Eugene road. About 1 mile beyond the Milton-Eugene road highway 4 bends slightly to the right. On your left you will see two stone gate posts. This is the entrance to Snow Ranch</p>

        <p>Once you have arrived at the ranch, follow the yellow sandwich-board signs to the launch site (about 10 minutes at 7 miles an hour.) You will go through two gates, make sure they are closed after you open and drive through them.</p>

        <h2>Brigantino Park</h2>
        <p><strong>Next Launch</strong>: None Scheduled</p>
        <p>The Brignatino Park Launch Site is located in Hollister, CA, about an hour south of the Bay Area. Launches are limited to low- and mid-power (A through G motors) with a maximum altitude of 1000 feet.</p>
        <p>The launch location on this field is about 200 yards from the parking lot. You will not be able to easily operate out of your car so be prepared to haul your rockets, tables, chairs, etc. to the launch location. A wagon would be very useful.</p>
        <p>The park is next to a ridge covered in oak trees, and poison oak vines, so be mindful of launch angles, winds, and recovery gear.</p>
        <p>Bathrooms are available by the parking lot.</p>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <address>
            Brignatino Park<br>
            2100 San Juan Hollister Rd.<br>
            Hollister, CA 95023
        </address>
        <p>Take 101 south through Gilroy then take 156 east to 156B (San Juan Hollister Rd.) and go east towards Hollister. The park is on the west side of Hollister on the south side of San Juan Hollister Rd.</p>

        <h2>Vendors</h2>
        <p><a href="https://rocket.supplies/">Rocket Supplies</a> will be onsite at most launches unless announced beforehand. They sell motors, recovery gear, components, and kits. Ordering in advance is appreciated so they can manage what inventory they bring to the launch.</p>
